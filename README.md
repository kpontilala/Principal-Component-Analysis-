# Principal-Component-Analysis-
Utilization of PCA component on the breast cancer dataset in sklearn datasets.

### Project Overview
As a Data analyst at the Anderson Cancer Center, you are tasked with developing a model to address the growing number of referrals at the center. This model's first step is to identify essential variables for securing donor funding. After consulting with your team, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been chosen as the most suitable technique for this task. 

### Project Description
You will perform the following tasks:
<li>PCA Implementation:</li> Utilize PCA to demonstrate how essential variables can be acquired from the cancer dataset available from sklearn.datasets.
<li>Dimensionality Reduction:</li> Reduce the dataset into 2 PCA components for the project.
<li>Implement logistic regression for prediction.</li>
